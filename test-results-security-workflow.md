- **Test Date**: 2025-06-23
- **Workflow File**: .github/workflows/security.yml
- **Repository**: zopiolabs/zopio_init

## 1. Git Flow Diagram Validation

### Branch Triggers
According to git-flow-diagram.md specifications:

| Requirement | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-------------|----------|--------|--------|
| Push to main | ✅ | ✅ (lines 24-25) | ✅ PASS |
| Push to develop | ✅ | ✅ (lines 24-25) | ✅ PASS |
| Push to staging | ✅ | ✅ (lines 24-25) | ✅ PASS |
| PR to main | ✅ | ✅ (lines 36-37) | ✅ PASS |
| PR to develop | ✅ | ✅ (lines 36-37) | ✅ PASS |
| PR to staging | ✅ | ✅ (lines 36-37) | ✅ PASS |
| Daily Schedule | 🕐 Daily 2 AM UTC | 🕐 Daily 2 AM UTC (line 50) | ✅ PASS |

### Path Ignores
The workflow correctly ignores documentation-only changes:
- `**/*.md` files
- `docs/**` directory
- GitHub documentation files
- LICENSE, CHANGELOG, README files
- `**/*.txt` files

✅ **PASS**: All path ignores match expectations

### Permissions
| Permission | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------------|----------|--------|--------|
| contents | read | read (line 53) | ✅ PASS |
| security-events | write | write (line 54) | ✅ PASS |

## 2. Security Scan Components per git-flow-diagram.md

According to the security framework in git-flow-diagram.md:

| Scanner | Type | Expected Schedule | Actual Schedule | Status |
|---------|------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| CodeQL | SAST | PR + Weekly | Separate workflow (codeql.yml) | ⚠️ INFO |
| Trivy | Dependencies | PR + Daily | ✅ PR + Daily (lines 56-74) | ✅ PASS |
| TruffleHog | Secrets | On PR | ✅ On PR (lines 76-92) | ✅ PASS |
| Semgrep | SAST | On PR | ✅ On PR (lines 94-134) | ✅ PASS |
| Docker scan | Container | Conditional | ✅ Conditional (lines 136-172) | ✅ PASS |

### Trivy Configuration
- ✅ Scans filesystem for vulnerabilities
- ✅ Outputs SARIF format for GitHub Security tab
- ✅ Filters CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM severities
- ✅ Ignores unfixed vulnerabilities
- ✅ Uploads results to GitHub Security

### TruffleHog Configuration  
- ✅ Full repository history scan (fetch-depth: 0)
- ✅ Compares against default branch
- ✅ Only reports verified secrets (--only-verified flag)
- ✅ Scans entire repository path

### Semgrep Configuration
- ✅ Proper Node.js 20 setup for accurate analysis
- ✅ Dependencies installed for type inference
- ✅ Comprehensive rule sets:
  - p/javascript
  - p/typescript
  - p/react
  - p/nextjs
  - p/security-audit
  - p/owasp-top-ten
- ✅ Results uploaded even on failure

### Docker Scan Configuration
- ✅ Conditional execution based on commit/PR title
- ✅ Checks for Dockerfile existence
- ✅ Builds local image for scanning
- ✅ Scans with Trivy for CRITICAL and HIGH severities
- ✅ Uploads results when successful

## 3. Workflow Triggers Matrix Validation

Per the matrix in git-flow-diagram.md:

| Check | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Security Scan on push to main | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ PASS |
| Security Scan on push to develop | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ PASS |
| Security Scan on push to staging | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ FAIL |
| Security Scan on PR | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ PASS |
| Security Scan daily schedule | 🕐 Daily | 🕐 Daily 2 AM | ✅ PASS |

### ❌ DISCREPANCY FOUND
The workflow triggers on push to staging, but according to git-flow-diagram.md line 295, Security Scan should NOT trigger on push to staging.
