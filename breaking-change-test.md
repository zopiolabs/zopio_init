# Breaking Change Test

This file is added to test breaking change detection in PR titles.

When a PR title contains `!` after the type (e.g., `feat!:`, `fix!:`), it should:
1. Add the appropriate type label
2. Add the `breaking change` label
3. Require documentation of breaking changes in PR description# Breaking change test
