# Test Branch Naming Workflow

This file is created to test the branch-naming.yml workflow.

## Test Case 1: Invalid Branch Name
- Branch: `test-invalid-branch-name`
- Expected: Workflow should fail and add a comment explaining the naming convention

## Purpose
Testing that the GitHub Actions workflow properly validates branch names according to the repository's naming conventions.
