# Test Branch Naming Workflow - Valid Branch

This file is created to test the branch-naming.yml workflow with a valid branch name.

## Test Case 2: Valid Branch Name
- Branch: `feat/test-branch-naming-workflow`
- Expected: Workflow should pass without any issues

## Purpose
Testing that the GitHub Actions workflow properly validates branch names and allows valid naming patterns.

## Valid Pattern Used
- Pattern: `feat/*` - for new features
- This follows the repository's branch naming conventions
