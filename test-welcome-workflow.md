# Welcome Workflow Test Results

## Test Execution Log

### Test Setup
- **Date**: 2025-06-23
- **Branch**: test/git-flow-validation-20250623-094854
- **Repository**: zopiolabs/zopio_init

### Test Execution

This file documents the test execution for the welcome workflow as part of the git flow validation process.

## Purpose
Testing the first-time contributor welcome messages workflow to ensure:
1. Welcome messages are posted for first-time contributors
2. Messages contain correct links and mentions
3. Workflow handles edge cases properly
4. pull_request_target allows commenting on fork PRs
