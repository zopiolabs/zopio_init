## üå≥ Branching Strategy

We follow a modified GitFlow branching model:

### Core Branches
- **main**: Production-ready code (protected, 2 reviews required from @zopiolabs/core)
- **develop**: Integration branch for features (protected, 1 review required)
- **staging**: Pre-production testing (protected, 1 review required)

### Supporting Branches
- **feat/\***: New features (create from develop, merge to develop)
- **release/\***: Release preparation (create from develop, merge to main and develop)
- **hotfix/\***: Emergency fixes (create from main, merge to main and develop)
- **docs/\***: Documentation updates (create from develop, merge to develop)

### Branch Naming Convention
- Features: `feat/descriptive-name`
- Releases: `release/v1.2.0`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/critical-fix`
- Documentation: `docs/update-xyz`

### Merge Strategies
- **feat/\* ‚Üí develop**: Squash and merge (preferred)
- **develop ‚Üí staging**: Merge commit
- **release/\* ‚Üí main**: Merge commit
- **hotfix/\* ‚Üí main**: Merge commit
