# Continuous Integration Pipeline
#
# Purpose: Main CI workflow that runs on every push and PR to ensure code quality,
#          test coverage, and security compliance across the monorepo.
#
# Triggers:
#   - Push to: main, develop, staging branches
#   - PRs to: main, develop, staging, release/*, version branches (v1.0, etc.)
#
# Jobs:
#   1. Setup: Install dependencies
#   2. Lint: Code quality checks with Biome
#   3. Test: Run test suite with Vitest
#   4. Build: Verify successful compilation
#   5. Security: CodeQL security analysis
#
# Features:
#   - Parallel job execution for speed
#   - Graceful handling of missing scripts
#   - Security scanning with CodeQL
#   - Frozen lockfile for reproducible builds
