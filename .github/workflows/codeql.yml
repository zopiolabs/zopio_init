# CodeQL Security Analysis
#
# Purpose: Automated security vulnerability scanning using GitHub's CodeQL engine
#          to detect potential security issues in JavaScript/TypeScript code.
#
# Triggers:
#   - Push to: main, develop, staging branches
#   - PRs to: main, develop, staging branches  
#   - Scheduled: Weekly on Monday at 3am UTC
#
# Features:
#   - Scans for security vulnerabilities and code quality issues
#   - Uses 'security-and-quality' query suite for comprehensive coverage
#   - Results are uploaded to GitHub Security tab
#   - Supports SARIF format for integration with other tools
#
# Query suites available:
#   - security-extended: High confidence security queries
#   - security-and-quality: Security + maintainability queries (used here)
#   - security-experimental: Latest experimental security queries
